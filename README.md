Step 1 — Download the Extension

Go to the GitHub repository.

Click the green Code button.

Select Download ZIP.

Extract the ZIP file to a permanent location on your PC
(for example: Documents/PinpointPlus).

Important: Do not delete this folder after installation — Microsoft Edge loads the extension directly from it.

Open Microsoft Edge.

In the address bar, navigate to:

edge://extensions

Step 3 — Enable Developer Mode

In the bottom-left corner of the page, toggle Developer mode to ON.

Additional options will appear at the top of the page.

Step 4 — Load the Extension

Click Load unpacked.

Select the extracted extension folder.

Click Select Folder.

The extension will now install.

Step 5 — Confirm It’s Working

The extension icon should now appear in your Edge toolbar.

Known Limitations (Early Build)

This version modifies the site using injected CSS and JavaScript.

Layouts may change if Pinpoint updates their website.

Bugs should be reported through GitHub Issues.
